    <p>This is my page discussing the importance of minion control on League of Legends.</p>
    <p> You must be able to effectively control when you are <strong>pushing</strong> and when you are <strong>freezing</strong> to increase your chances of winning!</p>
    <p> Some general guidelines to adhere to would be if the enemy is not in lane doing other objectives, <strong>PUSH</strong>, if the enemy is not in lane but is on their way, <strong>FREEZE.</strong> </p>
